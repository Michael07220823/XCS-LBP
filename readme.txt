We propose an eXtended Center-Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (XCS-LBP) descriptor for background modeling and subtraction in videos. By combining the strengths of the original LBP and the similar CS ones, it appears to be robust to illumination changes and noise, and produces short histograms, too. The experiments conducted on both synthetic and real videos (from the Background Models Challenge) of outdoor urban scenes under various conditions show that the proposed XCS-LBP outperforms its direct competitors for the background subtraction task.
